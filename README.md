# maze
## A maze generator written in Python3

Generates mazes using a backtracking implementation then converts those mazes into a png file.

Plan is to include multiple maze solving algorithms as well as support for the creation of braid and combo mazes

Thanks Guido Draheim whose conversion of python to PNG code serves as the base for the conversion between the generated mazes and .png files
